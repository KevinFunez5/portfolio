    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Welcome to my <span class="important">Portfolio.</span> I was born in Wilmington North Carolina! Lived there until I moved to Portland Oregon in May of 2021. I moved to Portland with my girlfriend who moved here a couple of months before I did. I am very outgoing and friendly person! I enjoy walking to the park with my dog, Luna, who also moved with me from Wilmington.The neighborhood we moved into is super nice. Lots of restaurants and the people are very friendly. I do wish my <em>bestfriends</em> could have tagged along with me on this journey. And since they were also very supportive I want to give them a shout out!</p>

    <h2>Why Programming?</h2>
    <p>The reason I chose to change my life forever and start to learn programming is because, I was not happy where my life was. I was at a job where I felt I was very underappreciated. I also have a very supportive family who were happy to see me excited about something I luckily know an alumn from Epicodus, Meaghan Jones, and she had only great things to say about Epicodus. So choosing Epicodus was an easy decision. Programming to me is creativity. Its freedom to do whatever you want. </p>
